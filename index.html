      <h2>Are Airbnb's part of Austin's affordable housing crisis?</h2>
  <br />
  <br />
    <p>
      Over the past year, a lot of people have taken a closer, more critical look, at how Airbnb is impacting housing markets in their highest renting cities. <br /> 
      Austin is one of Airbnb's poster children and also happens to have one of the fasting growing housing markets in the US right now. Could part of Austins housing market be fueled by Airbnb's mega hosts that list more than 10 units. The map below shows all of the units in Austin that are listed by hosts who have 10 or more listings on Airbnb.

    <p>“For years, New Yorkers have felt the burden of rents that go nowhere but up, and Airbnb is one reason why,” the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, said in an interview. “It’s just simply supply and demand. Fewer apartments to rent means higher prices, and that’s the Airbnb effect.”

    <p> "There are two kinds of horror stories about Airbnb. When the home-sharing platform first appeared, the initial cautionary tales tended to emphasize extreme guest (and occasionally host) misbehavior. But as the now decade-old service matured and the number of rental properties proliferated dramatically, a second genre emerged, one that focused on what the service was doing to the larger community: Airbnb was raising rents and taking housing off the rental market."
